## Guidelines for simulating Multi-UAVs with OMNet++

When creating a simulation, deciding whether it will be continuous or discrete is important.

A discrete simulation is a simulation where the user provides discrete events and there is the discretization of the simulation time. In this type of simulation, time is divided into discrete steps, and events are processed in chronological order.

While continuous simulation is not limited to the discretization of simulation time, it also involves continuous variables (constantly updated) as a function of time and events occurring without all being previously discretized.

For simulations of Multi-UAV Systems (Multiple Drones), there are 4 classic topologies:

- Star
- Multi-star
- Flat mesh
- Hierarchical Mesh

In OMNeT++, link UAVs based on the selected topology.

Main features:
These features can be useful for simulating Multi-UAV Systems in OMNeT++.

How to export data in simulation:

We can enable the record-eventlog property by setting true in omnetpp.ini to capture simulation data. With this, we can generate a chart of the sequence of messages exchanged in the simulation. It creates an Eventlog File and through the Sequence Chart Tool, it is possible to visualize it graphically.

Two ways of configuring simulation files in OMNeT++:

In omnet, it is possible to configure files in two ways: unified files and separate files.

Here is an application example simulating two UAVs using unified files: https://github.com/savionasc/mysterio/tree/main/quentin/uavs/unified
